# Force Social Distancing Plugin

Being nostalgic about COVID-19 safety measures that gave you a personal space? Introducing Force Social Distancing Plugin, allowing you to experience social distancing in Minecraft!

This plugin will prevent other players from getting too close to you. Once it gets too close, the player will be pushed away.

Joke aside, as this plugin is still in the development process, it didn't work at this moment yet. But please feel free to contribute to this project. I hope this plugin will be useful to you guys.
